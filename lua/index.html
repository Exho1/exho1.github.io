<h2>WHAT IS THIS</h2>
<p>This is Lua, a scripting language meant to be embedded into stuff mostly. Its not L.U.A., LUA, and definitely not Laua. Lua means moon in 
Portuguese, now you know. Its pretty similar to english.

<h2>VARIABLES</h2>
<p>Variables are ways to store information to be retrieved later. In Lua you have 2 types of variables: global and local. Global variables can be
accessed anywhere while local can only be accessed in the block of code they were defined. When you declare a variable but do not give it a
value, it has the value of "nil" which means nothing.
<br>
<br>local x = 2 -- Local
<br>message = "Keep the change you filthy animal" -- Global
<p>This will make more sense later but its generally better to declare variables local as to not overwrite other people's stuff.

<h2>TYPES</h2>
<p>Lua has a few different types of variables in order to hold variables of different kinds. Unlike other languages you don't need to declare
the variable type, Lua figures it out, but it still good that you know what type each variable is.
<br>
<br>Type - Example - Desc
<br>Boolean - true/false - Simple as that, boolean variables are either true or false.
<br>String - "heyo123" - Segments of text or other characters without a numeric value. They are created by wrapping text in quotation marks
<br>Number - 100.123 - Also self-explanatory. You don't have to define if a number is a decimal or integer.
<br>Table - {"First entry", "SecondEntry", ["Key"] = "value"} - Holds multiple variables of information in a Key-value format where the key is
the value's position in the table. The first two strings I entered into the table don't have a declared value so they will assume keys 1 and 2 but
the third example I declared as a string key.
<br>Function - function myFunc( x ) x = x + 1 end - Contains a block of code that can be called at will as many times as needed. It can also be
passed variables in the form of arguments and can return values to the code where the function is called
<br>Nil - local myName = nil - Not really a variable type but more accurately the absense of a useful value.
<p>All of these may seem like pretty simple concepts and you might wonder how on earth this could be used to make stuff like NPCs, HUDs, or
even entire gamemodes. Find some gamemode code on Github like TTT's source and read through it, a lot of these concepts are just used in 
different forms.

<h2>Operators</h2>

<h2>LOGIC</h2>
<p>The basic gist of coding is logical stuff such as loops and conditional statements. They are used to do things like check if a player is dead,
if a weapon is present at position (0,0,0), or if the color of a barrel is red.
<br>
<br>local x = 24
<br>if x > 25 then
<br>&nbsp;print("This isn't possible!!")
<br>else
<br>&nbsp;print("X is less than 25")
<br>end
<p>That is an 'if then' statement which checks if a condition is met and if so executes a block of code. If you want to run code when the 
condition fails you can add the 'else' keyword to run another block of code. Finally the statement is closed with the 'end' keyword which
tells Lua this statement is done and not to treat any code beyond this as being in this block.
<br>
<br>local money = 500
<br>while money < 1000 do
<br>&nbsp;print("need more money")
<br>&nbsp;money = money + 1 -- Increment the value of money by 1 each pass
<br>end
<p>This is a 'while do' loop which runs a block of code over and over until the condition is met, its a bad idea to use these in Garry's Mod
as you will crash your game. Each loop or iteration of this code will call the function 'print' and increase money by 1
